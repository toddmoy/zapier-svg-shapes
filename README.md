# Zapier SVG shapes

Our brand illustration primitives, exported to SVG and optimized for use.

## Instructions

The originals were exported from this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/A0b4ZfLube6fwdB7Y1wbwo/SVG-Images?node-id=0%3A1). To re-generate the optimized images, run:

```
yarn optimize
```

This kicks off [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo), using settings in `svgo.config.js`. Tweak those plugins to your liking.
